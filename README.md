# HeapImplementation
Max and Min Heap Implementation

# Heap Run Complexity

1.) Delete element:
O(Log n)

2.) Insert Element:
O(Log n)

3.) Get Min. or Max. value:
O(1)

# Heap General Implementation Notes
1.) Heaps are implemented in arrays/vectors much more easily thank link list implementations.
2.) The array/vector implementation allows for easire memory management with only 1 container created vs. N nodes.
3.) Less memory is needed due to not needing to store pointers.
4.) The memory is more tightly coupled and not stored in fragmented memory space.
5.) Iterating through an array is simpler to manage vs. refernce poitners to next nodes. (My Opinion)
